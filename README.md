# Project proposal: Predicting the Bias against Women's Roles in Movies
The Bechdel Test is a measure of the active presence of women in fiction. It poses whether the work of fiction meets the following criteria:
* The work has two named women
* These women talk to each other
* These women talk to each other about something other than a man
Can characteristics about a movie's production team determine whether the movie passes the Bechdel Test?
